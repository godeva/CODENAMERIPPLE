Android app based on geolocation with the concept of social media craze. Part of my hackathon project. 

Note: Feel free to add/modfiy to the app. Please make sure to provide me and our team credit any src is used. Thanks!

Concept: Android app based on Geolocation. The goal of the app is to help promote a new way of social interaction. The way it works is that the application tracks the users location when they are moving around. A map will be provided showing the users location. Users can add messages to where they have been on the map and depending on the privacy setting they can allow other users to view there comments on that location. Each comment has a radius in which users will receive on the map. The more likes a comment has, the wider the radius expands so more users can view the message. It plays with the concept of apps like Yik-Yak and expands that venue by adding more presence of a community.
